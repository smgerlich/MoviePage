		<p>Welcome. You've stumbled across a silly page that does nothing more than show you a little bit of detail about the movies currently listed 
		in my 'favorites' playlist on YouTube. You can click on any movie image above to get a description of the movie and watch a trailer. If you 
		want, you can also follow a link in the video to buy or rent
		a copy of the movie from Google.</p>
		<p>Now, I know what you're thinking... these are your favorite movies? Well, yes. They are. Clearly I'm getting a little long in the
		tooth, so I really only like semi-old movies about spies and wacky mishaps with Audrey Hepburn (with a little Bill Murray thrown in for good measure, I guess). There's nothing wrong with that. 
		And nuts to you for being so judgemental.</p>
